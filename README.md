Make sure you have Docker installed ( so Docker desktop or at least docker engine and docker compose if only in the CLI)
To run this program, in the command prompt type : docker compose up
Once you finish, in order not to keep it running in the background for nothing : docker compose down 

Should you want to try to do things fresh again ... I added the reset.sh file ( you should not needed it ).
This will delete any unused container and their volumes
