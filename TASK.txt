Hi Raph,

 

Hereâ€™s the take home test:

 

# fs-take-home-test

Fullstack interview test

Create a repo for this within github and share the link once complete

 

Objective

 

Build a simple CRUD application that has the following requirements/features:

 

    Application should start with docker compose up

    Three services:

        Postgres database

        FastAPI web app

        React front end

    Endpoints should be:

        GET /users - returns a list of all users

        DELETE /user - delete a user in the database

        POST /users/create - creates a user record in the db

    sqlalchemy as an ORM

 

A user has the following attributes:

 

    firstname

    lastname

    age

    date of birth

 

How you create the database table is your choice.

 

# Evaluation Criteria

 

The above task is designed to show your familiarity with the technology TMC uses.

 

Once complete, a non-technical person should be able to pull your repo and:

 

    Type docker compose up -d to start the application and via the interface:

      Add a user.

      View a list of all users.

      Delete a user from the list of all users

 

Submission

 

Once submitted, your application will be tested and in a short technical interview you will be asked to go over your code and answer some questions about the application.

 

If you don't include X in your final submission, then the assumption is you don't usually include X in your normal day-to-day coding. Please use this as an opportunity to show how you normally code and approach coding assignments (feel free to show off how good you really are!).
